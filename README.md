## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project demonstrates a modern serverless architecture using AWS services:

### Frontend

- **React.js**: Component-based UI with hooks for state management
- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering and static site generation
- **AWS Amplify**: Automated deployment with CI/CD pipeline
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts and weather condition displays

### Backend (Serverless)

- **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints with authentication
- **Lambda Functions**: Event-driven computing for API requests
- **Weather API Integration**: Proxied requests to external weather data providers
- **Efficient Caching**: Minimized API calls for better performance and reduced costs

### Authentication & Authorization

- **AWS Cognito**: User registration, login, and profile management
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure API access with token-based authentication
- **Protected Routes**: Client-side route protection for authenticated users
- **User Preferences**: Personalized settings stored per user

### Data Layer

- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL storage for user preferences and location data
- **Weather Cache**: Temporary storage to optimize third-party API usage

### Security

- **AWS Cognito**: Secure user authentication and authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Protected API access
- **IAM Roles**: Fine-grained permission control
